              In this lightning talk, I will talk about my experience revamping my blog using
              GatsbyJS and Netlify, and why it turned me from a JavaScript hater to a JavaScript
              lover again.

              In this Leadership Master Class session, I'll be talking about the adaptability
              of an organisation and an individual, and how things could affect an organisation
              as well as one's career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll cover concepts that are fundamental but easy to overlook, as well as
              interesting concepts that I personally observed/invented over my decade-long
              career.

              In this session I will take you through some of the git functionalities beyond
              the simple "commit", "push" and "pull". It is important for every developer to
              know his/her tools well, and git is a very important tool we use on a daily basis.
              Surprisingly, 9 out of 10 interview candidates I'd come across could not explain
              the difference between "git merge" and "git rebase".

              Writing Maintainable Code - Leave a Place Better Than You Found It

            <p>
              As we're nearing the end of 2018, some of us have started brainstorming and kicking
              off work for Q1 2019. As the teams grow and products grow, it is crucial for us to
              write maintainable code to support the ever-growing business needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Six years ago I did a conference talk on&nbsp;
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeBsmdDmB9A">a similar topic</a>: I would
              love to talk about maintainable code again - writing maintainable code is a very
              hard thing to do especially in a fast-moving environment like Xplor. That said,
              I'd like everyone to start having the mentality of building maintainable code by
              default, and making conscious trade-offs when necessary.

              I'm excited to bring you another Lunch &amp; Learn session. This time the topic is
               about my story on open source - it is mostly tech oriented, but if you are
               interested in or curious about open source software and its community, you're
               more than welcome to join us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the things I will cover include:
              <ul>
                <li>open source projects I've contributed to</li>
                <li>where to start if you're interested in contributing to an open source project (spoiler: it's NOT just about coding!)</li>
                <li>how to use open source contributions to lift your work and boost your career, and vice versa</li>
                <li>the opportunities and benefits you get from contributing to the open source community</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The goals of this topic are:
              <ul>
                <li>to introduce you to the wonderful world of open source, if you are not already familiar with it</li>
                <li>to give you ideas on what to build and contribute</li>
                <li>to hopefully inspire you to do (more) open source work</li>
                <li>to hopefully help you become a better developer</li>

              Grew up in Shanghai, China, I quickly became interested in computers and the
              Internet at the age of 13. I started off by creating simple websites using
              basic HTML I learnt from reading computer magazines back in 1997. Later on I
              worked in online publishing, marketing and web hosting while studying in high
              school.

              After being a "webmaster" for a few years, I began my career in web development
              and design. I graduated with Bachelor of Information Technology and Systems
              from <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a> in 2008.

              I am currently the Head of Engineering at <a href="https://verrency.com/">Verrency</a> -

              such as <a href="https://envato.com/">Envato</a>
              , <a href="https://sitepoint.com/">SitePoint</a>

              I am a passionate open source developer who has made contributions
              to <a href="https://github.com/fredwu/">dozens of open source projects</a>,

              My <Link to="/manager-readme">leadership style</Link> is people focused. I truly believe in building a champion
              team, and to have the team to work collaboratively to achieve great outcome. I
              see myself as a server as opposed to a manager, of a team. I take unconditional,
              genuine care of the team to build rapport and trust.

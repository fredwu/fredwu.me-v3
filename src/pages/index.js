              Grew up in Shanghai, China, I quickly became interested in computers and the
              Internet at the age of 13. I started off by creating simple websites using
              basic HTML I learnt from reading computer magazines back in 1997. Later on I
              worked in online publishing, marketing and web hosting while studying in high
              school.

              After being a "webmaster" for a few years, I began my career in web development

              My leadership style is people focused. I truely believe in building a champion
              team, and to have the team to work collaboratively to achieve great outcome. I
              see myself as a server as opposed to a manager, of a team. I take unconditional,
              genuine care of the team to build rapport and trust.

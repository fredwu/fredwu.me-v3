In case you donâ€™t already know, both [PunyPNG](http://www.gracepointafterfive.com/punypng/) and [Smush.it](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/smushit/) are lossless image compression services.

From my experience, PunyPNG produces better results than Smush.it does.

The sprite image for this blog yields 160kb when it was created. Smush.it reduced the size by 30%, PunyPNG reduced the size by 50%.

The [PunyPNG API](http://www.gracepointafterfive.com/punypng/api) is going to be extremely useful when it is out of beta.

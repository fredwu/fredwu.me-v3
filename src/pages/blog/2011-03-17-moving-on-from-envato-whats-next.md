Today is my last day at [Envato](http://envato.com/). I have been working here for a year and half and it has been, without a doubt the most fulfilling experience I have ever had in my professional career.

I was hired as a PHP developer initially. Who knew, several months into the job I was ‘converted’ voluntarily to a full time Ruby developer - and it has been _the_ highlight of my career progression. It is hard to imagine what I would have become if it wasn’t for Envato’s support behind my conversion.

During my time at Envato, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most talented people in the web industry, from both inside Envato and externally. I am extremely grateful for the experience and I hope to work with them again in the future.

The decision of moving on from Envato was not made easily. As a matter of fact, I have always been passionate about online education (e.g. the [Tuts+ network](http://tutsplus.com/)) and I sincerely hope the project will be taken to the next level.


Oh hey, I am still working on a book project with [Rockable Press](http://rockablepress.com/) from Envato. If you are a web developer, expect to see a (hopefully useful) web development book this year. ;)

10 days from now I will be joining [PlayUp](http://playup.com/) as a senior web developer - to work on more awesome Ruby/Rails stuff! :) The colleagues I have already met at PlayUp are extremely talented and friendly. I cannot wait to start my first day there!

Aside from my day job, I am also working with some very experienced professionals on a startup project - hopefully you will get to hear more about it soon.

Last but not least, I am finally out of some personal and relationship crisis, and I am able to regain my focus and spend more time working on my varies side projects (to be branded under [Wuit](http://wuit.com/)) as well as on some of the open source projects such as [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/).

Exciting times ahead! :)

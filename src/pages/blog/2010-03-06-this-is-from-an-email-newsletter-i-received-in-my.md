This is from an email newsletter I received in my Gmail inbox from [Macheist](http://www.macheist.com/). Note to all the designers out there, please don’t use fancy CSS, not even some of the basic ones, because they don’t work in email clients! [Here’s a great table of contents](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/) on what you can and cannot use for different email clients.

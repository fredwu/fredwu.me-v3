Today I noticed that I don’t have Skype installed, so naturally, I went to Skype.com. Then I was presented with their homepage:

The problem? No "Download" action button above the fold, or below the fold for that matter. That is, quite frankly, shocking.


So I hovered on the "Get Skype" drop down menu and clicked on the one for Mac. On the new page I was presented with, I clicked on the "Download Skype" button. And then …

Oh snap! You’d have to either create an account or sign in before you could download Skype! Worse, by default it shows you the create an account section, and that section took a good 10 seconds to load for me for the first time.

Is this some kind of prank from the Microsoft enterprise? \*shakes head\*

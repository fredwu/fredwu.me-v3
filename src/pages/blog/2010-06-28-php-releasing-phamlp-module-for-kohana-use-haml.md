[Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) are two extremely useful template engines. They are very popular amongst the Ruby and Rails community.

I am happy to release a module for [Kohana v3](http://kohanaframework.org/) that uses the [PHamlP library](http://code.google.com/p/phamlp/) to offer Haml/Sass support for Kohana.

Right now the module only supports Haml but I will be adding Sass support in the very near future.

Head over to GitHub to [check out the source code](http://github.com/fredwu/kohana-phamlp). :)

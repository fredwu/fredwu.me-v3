I have just [pushed a commit](http://github.com/fredwu/inherited_resources_views/commit/5fd1f928a0ee1f31f413794b8569505ac072f814) that added Rails 2.x compatibility to [Inherited Resources Views](http://github.com/fredwu/inherited_resources_views). Please give it a spin! :-)

P.S. I’ve only tested it on Rails 2.3.8.

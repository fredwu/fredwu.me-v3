If you havenâ€™t already been using [AppConfig](http://github.com/fredwu/app_config) in your Rails project, well, you should!

Jacques Crocker has recently released his new version of the original AppConfig - [**RailsConfig**](http://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config). I was invited to join the development of this new tool, so make sure you go [check it out](http://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config). :-)

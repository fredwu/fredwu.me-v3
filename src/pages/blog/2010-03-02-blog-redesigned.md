After spending the weekend coming up with the design, one night of chopping and slicing and half a night of [Tumblr themeing](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes), I have finally done it!

Thanks to [960.gs](http://960.gs/) and the [Variable Grid System](http://www.spry-soft.com/grids/), they made making layout so easy!

The theme is tested in all major browsers, [except IE6](http://whichbrowserforme.org/). Let me know what you think! :-)

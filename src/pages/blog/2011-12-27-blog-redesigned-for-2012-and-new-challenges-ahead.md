After four days of sketching, designing and cutting up HTML/CSS, the new design (as you are seeing now) is finally live!

The new design is structurally similar to [the old design](/blog/2010-03-02-blog-redesigned/), but with a fresh header and better use of space.

A new year warrants a fresh start. Apart from the redesign, I have also started heading up the development effort at [SitePoint](http://sitepoint.com/) - dozens of interesting and challenging projects ahead!

2012 will be an awesome year! :)

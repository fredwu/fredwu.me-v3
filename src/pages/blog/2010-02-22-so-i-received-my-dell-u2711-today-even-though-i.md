So I received my Dell U2711 today, even though I was told by a sales rep it will be delivered tomorrow. ;-)

The thing is, I ordered a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort connector and it’s not here yet. So instead of enjoying the native 2560x1440 resolution, I have to put up with 1920x1080 for now. It’s still a nice upgrade from my ViewSonic 20" (1680x1050).

Don’t you just hate it when you have a fresh intall of Mountain Lion, RVM and some rubies - then all of a sudden you hit this `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError` error message:

> SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed

The fix is quite simple actually, all you need to do is to download a CA root certificate:

```shell
curl http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem -o ~/.rvm/usr/ssl/cert.pem
```

And that’s it! Enjoy!

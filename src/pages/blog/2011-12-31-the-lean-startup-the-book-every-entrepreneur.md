Holidays period is the perfect time to gear up and learn a thing or two from the masters - and as it turned out, reading Eric Ries’ [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) is one of the most exciting and joyful things I’ve done during the holidays.

In this book you won’t find long-winded and boring theories, instead the book is full of real world use cases and practical advices.

If you are an entrepreneur, or if you are responsible for product development, I urge you to read this book if you haven’t already. :)

The other day a colleague asked whether or not itâ€™s possible to have [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) return a group that only contains uncommitted changes.

The answer is **yes**! After some digging around, we found the following way:

```ruby
# in spec_helper.rb
SimpleCov.start 'rails' do
  add_group 'Changed' do |source_file|
    `git ls-files --exclude-standard --others \
      && git diff --name-only \
      && git diff --name-only --cached`.split("\n").detect do |filename|
      source_file.filename.ends_with?(filename)
    end
  end
end
```

Basically use `git ls-files --exclude-standard --others` for untracked files, `git diff --name-only` for unstaged files and `git diff --name-only --cached` for staged files.

Today Opera has released its [latest and greatest version of Opera browser 10.5 Beta for Mac](http://www.opera.com/browser/next/). It features speed enhancement as well as a unified Cocoa interface. Just how speedy is it exactly? Letâ€™s test it out against other major browsers.

The benchmarks were run on my Macbook Pro (OS X 10.6.2, 2.53GHz CPU, 4GB RAM). I have performed three benchmark tests from [Dromaeo](http://dromaeo.com/) - [All JavaScript Tests](http://dromaeo.com/?dromaeo%7Csunspider%7Cv8), [DOM Core Tests](http://dromaeo.com/?dom) and [JavaScript Library Tests](http://dromaeo.com/?jslib). The following browsers are used:

- Firefox 3.6
- Minefield (Latest Firefox Nightly)
- Safari 4.0.4
- WebKit Latest Nightly
- Chrome 5.0 Beta
- Chromium Latest Nightly
- Opera 10.5 Beta 1

The benchmark result (the higher the better):

Opera is smoking fast for pure JavaScript execution, on the other hand its DOM performance is significant lower than its competitors.

Very interesting result, hey? ;)

It isn’t the [first](http://www.woopra.com/) [time](http://chartbeat.com/) realtime website traffic analysis has been introduced. [Reinvigorate](http://reinvigorate.net/) is one of the services that provides realtime traffic tracking and analysis.

The thing I like it most though, is in fact the heatmap. :-)

Heatmap is a great tool to help identify convoluted interface and improve the user experience.

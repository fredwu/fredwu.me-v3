Rails 3 has recently [renamed `key` method to `to_key`](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f81c6bc0404ba2a03eed0ec6c08bbac45661305f), which consequently rendered [MongoMapper](http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper) unusable.

You might see an error that looks like:

```
ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `to_key' for #<Post:0x000001066e4020>)
```

After some twiddling I’ve [submitted a patch](http://github.com/fredwu/mongomapper/commit/6e5e531312ef98c30e33286a1f80dd000468ed07) to address this issue. Feel free to pull my fork until the fix makes its way into [John Nunemaker’s main repository](http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper).

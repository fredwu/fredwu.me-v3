So, you are using Slim, right? If not, go [check it out](https://github.com/stonean/slim) because it’s awesome. ;)

Now, I don’t know about you but prior to Slim I use Haml quite a bit, and even though syntax-wise Haml and Slim have a lot in common, it’s still quite a challenge to convert all Haml templates to Slim templates.

As a result, let me present you with a quick n’ dirty Haml2Slim converter! [Check out the source code.](https://github.com/fredwu/haml2slim)

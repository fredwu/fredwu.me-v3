For the past few weeks I have started contributing to a small project - [Slim](http://github.com/stonean/slim).

> Slim is a fast, lightweight templating engine for Rails 3. It has been tested on Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby/REE 1.8.7. Slim is heavily influenced by [Haml](http://github.com/nex3/haml) and [Jade](http://github.com/visionmedia/jade).

[Andrew Stone](http://github.com/stonean) who is the author of the project has posted [a quick update](http://stonean.com/slim-update) on the latest feature additions to Slim. Please go check it out.

The source code of Slim is [available on Github](http://github.com/stonean/slim).

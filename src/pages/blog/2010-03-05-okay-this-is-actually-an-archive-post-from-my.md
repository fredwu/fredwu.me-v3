Okay, this is actually [an archive post from my other blog Beyond Coding](http://www.beyondcoding.com/2009/03/14/screenshot-windows-7-is-created-from-the-future/), but I feel like reposting it here for some humour. :)

> _Today I decided to upgrade my Windows 7 build 7000 to the latest build 7057. The system is installed on my Fujitsu P1610 which I use as an e-book reader and ultra-portable._
>
> _I ran the DVD inside Windows, then I chose to archive the old installation and install the new version from scratch._
>
> _Here is a screenshot of the archived Windows folder, apparently Microsoft has implemented some alien technologies we are not aware of that magically bend time!_

At [Envato](http://envato.com/) we have a few dozen sites residing on multiple servers. The data on a portion of the servers need to be regularly backed up to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

The Envato Mad Scientist [Ryan Allen](http://github.com/ryan-allen) has worked on a script called [Sir Sync-A-Lot](http://github.com/ryan-allen/sir-sync-a-lot) which syncs the data to S3. This was done after evaluating a bunch of scripts including [s3sync](http://www.s3sync.net/).

Today I turned Ryanâ€™s original script into [a little Rubygem](http://rubygems.org/gems/ssync) and added a bit more features.

Go [check out the source code](https://github.com/fredwu/ssync)!

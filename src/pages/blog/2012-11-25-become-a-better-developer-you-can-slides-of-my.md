Contrary to what the title of the talk suggests, I am by no means a superstar developer myself. Though I would like to think that I am extremely passionate about what I do, therefore I love to share my thoughts and tips on web development and software engineering.

Below is the version I used for my actual talk:

Since I had been preparing for my talk for over a month, I’ve done many revisions to my slides. Here’s an uncut version that contains every single slide since day one:
